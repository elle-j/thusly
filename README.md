# The Thusly Programming Language

A general-purpose programming language coming to life through a custom one-pass compiler and a stack-based virtual machine.

> üëâÔ∏è The language is currently being developed, but the implemented features can be seen in [Milestones](#milestones). This README is also in development.

### Milestone 3: Provide an interactive playground

- [x] A Thusly VM can run and execute code in the browser via an interactive playground.

### Milestone 4: Support first-class functions

- [ ] Functions can be defined and invoked.
- [ ] Closures are supported.
- [ ] Functions are first-class citizens.
- [ ] TODO (more milestones will be added here)

### Example Input

This section is for briefly demonstrating implemented functionality thus far and expected behavior when [running your code](#getting-started).

By inputting code from either a file or via the REPL, the VM will interpret it and output the result if an `@out` statement is used.

**Table 1: Valid user input (expressions)**

| Example input                | Expected output | Expected precedence parsing     |
|------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| `1 + 2 * 3 / 4`              | 2.5             | `1 + ((2 * 3) / 4)`             |
| `(1 + 2) * 3 / 4`            | 2.25            | `((1 + 2) * 3) / 4`             |
| `1 + -2 - -3`                | 2               | `(1 + (-2)) - (-3)`             |
| `1 > 2 = 3 > 4`              | true            | `(1 > 2) = (3 > 4)`             |
| `false != not(1 + 2 >= 3)`   | false           | `false != (not((1 + 2) >= 3))`  |
| `"he" + "llo" = "hello"`     | true            | `("he" + "llo") = "hello"`      |
| `"keep " + "on " + "coding"` | keep on coding  | `("keep " + "on ") + "coding"`  |
| `false and false or true`    | true            | `(false and false) or true`     |
| `true or true and false`     | true            | `true or (true and false)`      |

**Table 2: Valid user input (statements)**

| Example input              | Expected output |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| `var first: "Jane"`<br>`var last: "Doe"`<br>`var full: first + " " + last`<br>`@out full` | Jane Doe         |
| `var x: 1`<br>`var y: 2`<br>`var z: x: y`<br>`@out x`<br>`@out z` | 2<br>2         |
| `var x: "global"`<br>`@out x`<br><br>`block`<br>`  x: "changed global"`<br>`  var x: "local"`<br>`  @out x`<br>`end`<br><br>`@out x` | global<br>local<br>changed global         |
| `var x: 0`<br>`if x < 5`<br>`  @out "in if"`<br>`else`<br>`  @out "in else"`<br>`end` | in if   |
| `foreach value in 0..2`<br>`  @out value`<br>`end` | 0<br>1<br>2   |
| `var a: 0`<br>`var b: 2`<br>`var c: 0.5`<br>`foreach value in a..b step c`<br>`  @out value`<br>`end` | 0<br>0.5<br>1<br>1.5<br>2   |
| `var x: 0`<br>`while x < 4 {x +: 1}`<br>`  @out x`<br>`end` | 0<br>1<br>2<br>3   |

**Table 3: Invalid user input**

| Example input   | Error type | Expected error reason                           |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `"one" + 2`     | Runtime    | `+` operates on `number` only or `text` only    |
| `"one" < 2`     | Runtime    | `<` operates on `number` only                   |
| `!true`         | Comptime   | `!` is only allowed in `!=` (use `not`)         |
| `x: 1`          | Comptime   | `x` has not been declared                       |
| `var x: 1`<br>`1 + x: 2` | Comptime   | `1 + x` is an invalid assignment target<br>(`+` has higher precedence than `:`)  |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A C compiler (e.g. Clang or GCC)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.20 or later

### Building the Project

Run the below command to make Thusly come to life. It will create a top-level `bin` directory where the configured and compiled project will be located along with the executable binary `cthusly`.

```sh
./build.sh
```

> **If permission is denied**, first add executable permission to the build script by running:
> `chmod +x build.sh`.

### Running Code

Once you have [built](#building-the-project) the project you can go ahead and feed it some code to interpret thusly (..get it?):

**Usage example:**

```
$ ./bin/cthusly --help

Usage: ./bin/cthusly [options] [path]

    The REPL (interactive prompt) starts if no [path] is provided

    -h,     --help           Show usage
    -d,     --debug          Enable all debug flags below
    -dcomp, --debug-comp     Show compiler output (bytecode)
    -dexec, --debug-exec     Show VM execution trace
```

> **Flags:**
>
> Currently, only 1 flag may be provided.

**Interpret code from a file:**

```sh
./bin/cthusly path/to/your/file
```

**Start the REPL (interactive prompt):**

```sh
./bin/cthusly
```

> **Exit REPL:**
>
> Press `Cmd + D` (Mac) or `Ctrl + D` (Windows).

Example:

```
$ ./bin/cthusly

> @out "he" + "llo" = "hello"
true
> @out (1 + 2) * 3 / 4
2.25
> 
```

> **Enable/disable debug:**
>
> For the [debug flags](#running-code) to have an effect, the following macro in [src/common.h](src/common.h) need to be defined.
>
> * **DEBUG_MODE**
>
> You may comment or uncomment it to disable or enable support for the flags (then [rebuild](#building-the-project) the project).

# The Thusly Programming Language

A general-purpose programming language coming to life through a custom one-pass compiler and a stack-based virtual machine.

> üëâÔ∏è The language is currently being developed but has a working initial implementation of a small subset (see [Milestones](#milestones)). This README is also in development.

## Language

### Characteristics

* General-purpose
* Interpreted
* Dynamically typed
* Imperative
* Garbage collected

### Syntax

The development of both the language and the surrounding documentation is currently on-going, but the following is a subset of the language:

Whitespace is semantically insignificant except for newline characters on non-blank lines.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Support arithmetic, comparison, and equality operations

- [x] The terminals in the initial [grammar](design/grammar.txt) can be identified from user input via a multi-line file or single-line REPL input and then tokenized.
- [x] Arithmetic expressions using `number` (double) can be evaluated.
  - [x] Addition (`+`)
  - [x] Subtraction (`-`)
  - [x] Multiplication (`*`)
  - [x] Division (`/`)
  - [x] Modulo (`mod`)
  - [x] Unary negation (`-`)
  - [x] Precedence altering (`()`)
- [x] Comparison expressions using `number` can be evaluated.
  - [x] Greater than (`>`)
  - [x] Greater than or equal to (`>=`)
  - [x] Less than (`<`)
  - [x] Less than or equal to (`<=`)
- [x] Equality and logical negation expressions using `number`, `boolean`, `text` (string), and `none` can be evaluated.
  - [x] Equal to (`=`)
  - [x] Not equal to (`!=`)
  - [x] Logical not (`not`)
- [x] Concatenation of `text` literals using `+` can be evaluated.

### Milestone 2: Support variables and control flow

- [x] Temporary `@out` statement can be executed.
- [x] Global and local variables can be defined and used.
  - [x] Declaration and initialization (`var <name> : <expression>`)
  - [x] Assignment expression (`<name> : <expression>`)
- [x] Variables adhere to lexical scope.
  - [x] Standalone block
    ```
    block
      <statements>
    end
    ```
- [x] Logical operators can be evaluated.
  - [x] Conjunction (`and`)
  - [x] Disjunction (`or`)
- [ ] Control flow statements can be executed.
  - [ ] Selection
    - [x] `if`
    - [ ] `elseif`
    - [x] `else`
    ```
    if <expression>
      <statements>
    elseif <expression>
      <statements>
    else
      <statements>
    end
    ```
  - [ ] Loops
    - [ ] Bounded (`foreach`)
    - [ ] Unbounded (`while`)
- [ ] Range comparison expression (`in`) can be evaluated.
- [ ] TODO (more milestones will be added here)

### Milestone 3: Support first-class functions

- [ ] Functions can be defined and invoked.
- [ ] Closures are supported.
- [ ] Functions are first-class citizens.
- [ ] TODO (more milestones will be added here)

### Example Input

This section is for briefly demonstrating implemented functionality thus far and expected behavior when [running your code](#getting-started).

By inputting code from either a file or via the REPL, the VM will interpret it and output the result if an `@out` statement is used.

**Table 1: Valid user input (expressions)**

| Example input                | Expected output | Expected precedence parsing   |
|------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| `1 + 2 * 3 / 4`              | 2.5             | 1 + ((2 * 3) / 4)             |
| `(1 + 2) * 3 / 4`            | 2.25            | ((1 + 2) * 3) / 4             |
| `1 + -2 - -3`                | 2               | (1 + (-2)) - (-3)             |
| `1 > 2 = 3 > 4`              | true            | (1 > 2) = (3 > 4)             |
| `false != not(1 + 2 >= 3)`   | false           | false != (not((1 + 2) >= 3))  |
| `"he" + "llo" = "hello"`     | true            | ("he" + "llo") = "hello"      |
| `"keep " + "on " + "coding"` | keep on coding  | ("keep " + "on ") + "coding"  |
| `false and false or true`    | true            | (false and false) or true     |
| `true or true and false`     | true            | true or (true and false)      |

**Table 2: Valid user input (statements)**

| Example input              | Expected output |
|----------------------------|-----------------|
| `var first: "Jane"`<br>`var last: "Doe"`<br>`var full: first + " " + last`<br>`@out full` | Jane Doe         |
| `var x: 1`<br>`var y: 2`<br>`var z: x: y`<br>`@out x`<br>`@out z` | 2<br>2         |
| `var x: "global"`<br>`@out x`<br><br>`block`<br>`  x: "changed global"`<br>`  var x: "local"`<br>`  @out x`<br>`end`<br><br>`@out x` | global<br>local<br>changed global         |
| `var x: 0`<br>`if x < 10`<br>`  @out "in if"`<br>`else`<br>`  @out "in else"`<br>`end` | in if   |

**Table 3: Invalid user input**

| Example input   | Error type | Expected error reason                           |
|-----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `"one" + 2`     | Runtime    | `+` operates on `number` only or `text` only    |
| `"one" < 2`     | Runtime    | `<` operates on `number` only                   |
| `!true`         | Comptime   | `!` is only allowed in `!=` (use `not`)         |
| `x: 1`          | Comptime   | `x` has not been declared                       |
| `var x: 1`<br>`1 + x: 2` | Comptime   | `1 + x` is an invalid assignment target<br>(`+` has higher precedence than `:`)  |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A C compiler (e.g. Clang or GCC)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.20 or later

### Building the Project

Run the below command to make Thusly come to life. It will create a top-level `bin` directory where the configured and compiled project will be located along with the executable binary `cthusly`.

```sh
./build.sh
```

> If permission is denied, first add executable permission to the build script by running:
> `chmod +x build.sh`.

### Running Code

Once you have [built](#building-the-project) the project you can go ahead and feed it some code to interpret thusly (..get it?):

**Usage example** (use the flag `-h` or `--help`):

```
$ ./bin/cthusly --help

Usage: ./bin/cthusly [options] [path]

    REPL (interactive prompt) starts if no [path] is provided

    -h, --help                Show usage
```

**Interpret code from a file:**

```sh
./bin/cthusly path/to/your/file
```

**Start the REPL (interactive prompt):**

```sh
./bin/cthusly
```

Example:

```
$ ./bin/cthusly

> @out "he" + "llo" = "hello"
true
> @out (1 + 2) * 3 / 4
2.25
> 
```

> **Enable/disable debug output:**
>
> Comment or uncomment the following macros in [src/common.h](src/common.h) to disable or enable printouts (then [rebuild](#building-the-project) the project):
>
> **DEBUG_COMPILATION**
>   - Prints the entire bytecode produced by the compiler.
>
> **DEBUG_EXECUTION**
>   - Prints the VM execution steps including its stack state.
